# trash-bot
**trash-bot** is a voice activated smart dustbin that automatically disposes its contents whenever necessary. It does it by following a fixed path (black tape on the floor). The dustbin has sensors to detect when it is full and when the local waste management services are nearby. Once these conditions are met the bot will move along its predetermined path in order to hand over the waste.**trash-bot** has a gesture operated lid that swings open when an object is brought close to its lid.
